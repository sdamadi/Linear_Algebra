# Introduction to linear algebra
This repository includes supporting materials for my videos in `Introduction to linear algebra` playlist on my Youtube channel [@mathelecs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5ZK0iyo5U5-lCbVb6U9SVA/videos). You can find all playlists [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5ZK0iyo5U5-lCbVb6U9SVA/playlists).

There are two types of videos I am refering to:
1. Videos that I have created to conney the message better. They are found [here]().
2. Videos that explain related materials in a very short and excelent way. You can find them [here]().
