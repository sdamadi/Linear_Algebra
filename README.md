# Introduction to linear algebra
This repository includes supporting materials for my videos in `Introduction to linear algebra` playlist on my Youtube channel [@mathelecs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5ZK0iyo5U5-lCbVb6U9SVA/videos). You can find all playlists [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5ZK0iyo5U5-lCbVb6U9SVA/playlists).

There are two types of videos I am referring to:
1. Videos that I have created to convey the message better. They are found [here](https://github.com/sdamadi/Linear_Algebra/blob/main/Concepts%20videos/my_playlist.md).
2. Videos that explain related materials in a very short and excellent way. You can find them [here](https://github.com/sdamadi/Linear_Algebra/blob/main/Supplementary%20videos/from_Youtube.md).
